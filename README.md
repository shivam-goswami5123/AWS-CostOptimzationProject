# üöÄ AWS Cost üí∞Optimization  Project  

## Problem Statement  

**"Automated Cost Optimization of AWS EBS Snapshots"**  

In cloud environments, managing storage resources efficiently is crucial to minimizing costs. AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) snapshots, while essential for backups and disaster recovery, can accumulate over time and result in significant unnecessary expenses if not monitored and managed properly.  

Unused snapshots, or snapshots associated with deleted volumes or unused resources, contribute to this cost overhead. Additionally, identifying and removing such snapshots manually can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially in environments with numerous snapshots.  

This project aims to design and implement a **serverless solution** for automating the management of AWS EBS snapshots.  

The solution will:  
1. Identify stale snapshots that are either:  
   - Not attached to any volume.  
   - Associated with volumes that are not attached to any running EC2 instance.  
2. Check if the snapshot was created more than **10 minutes ago** to ensure recent backups are retained.  
3. Automatically delete such snapshots or provide notifications for further action.  

The project leverages **AWS services** to create a cost-efficient and scalable solution, enabling teams to focus on more critical tasks while reducing cloud infrastructure costs.

## Tools and Services Used  

### 1. **AWS Lambda** üñ•Ô∏è  
   - Executes the Python script to automate snapshot checks and deletions.  
   - Serverless execution reduces the need for provisioning resources.  

### 2. **Amazon CloudWatch** üìä  
   - Monitors the execution of the Lambda function and generates logs for debugging and tracking.  

### 3. **AWS EventBridge** üîÑ  
   - Schedules periodic triggers for the Lambda function, ensuring automation.  

### 4. **Python (boto3 Library)** üêç  
   - The `boto3` library interacts with AWS services (EC2, snapshots, volumes).  
   - Implements logic to identify stale snapshots based on conditions (e.g., snapshot age, volume state).
